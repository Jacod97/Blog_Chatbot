I was born on February 16, 1997, in Busan, South Korea. Spatial data, big data, and the broader field of artificial intelligence have long fascinated me. When working with data, I conduct exploratory data analysis using Pandas, GeoPandas, and NumPy, and in the modeling stage I build deep-learning models with scikit-learn and PyTorch. I have experience deploying trained models as services through FastAPI, and I can manage spatial databases with PostgreSQL and PostGIS. If I list the tools that currently make up my skill set, they would be: Python, PyTorch, FastAPI, scikit-learn, LangChain, OpenCV, Linux, SQLite, PostgreSQL, GitHub, and React. Based on these tools, I continue to build my capabilities and expand the horizon of my career.

Looking back, I originally started as a civil engineer. By taking part in various projects, I learned how to communicate smoothly with stakeholders and collaborate effectively. From March 2012 to February 2015, I studied at Namil High School in Busan, and in March 2015 I entered Dong-A University’s Department of Construction Systems Engineering to major in civil engineering. I steadily built an academic foundation and earned my bachelor’s degree in August 2022. After graduation, from September 2023 to October 2024, I worked as a civil engineer in the Road Division at Sambo Engineering & Construction in Seoul. During this period, I carried out road and highway design projects and gained project-management experience through collaboration with diverse companies.

However, I became captivated by the potential of artificial intelligence. Confronted with the everyday, repetitive problems I faced on site, I found myself asking, “Couldn’t these problems be solved sufficiently with computers?” In reality, computer technology is advancing rapidly, yet it has not fully permeated every industrial setting. That is why I decided to transition to becoming an AI engineer. From December 2024 to May 2025, I completed Wanted Lab’s **“PotenUP Data AI Developer Training Program”**, learning AI theory and practical development methods in a systematic manner. From May to July 2025, I then worked as an R\&D intern at WisePlus. There, I used Python, QGIS, and PostgreSQL to perform data quality control for flood-risk maps and conducted flood scenario analyses using SWMM. And starting in September 2025, I will be working as an AI engineer at SLZ in Seoul, developing various projects that combine digital twins with AI technologies. This is not a simple job change; it is my response to tackle the problems I witnessed in the field with data, models, and systems.

I also want to record a note about this page (this space I run). It is an introduction page created so that people not only in Korea but also in many other countries can get to know me, and it is an experimental space where they can interact with me indirectly through a ChatBot. Here we communicate only in English. Even without exchanging emails directly, we can send messages to each other through the ChatBot. On this page, you can find my profile, timeline, projects, and interview-style introductions. I am neither a web developer nor a designer, so I hope readers will understand that the page’s design may not be particularly trendy. Still, I aim to persuade with content and functionality.

I also want to be precise about the research and areas I plan to focus on going forward. I have a deep interest in smart cities. In the past, police had to patrol the city on foot to prevent crimes in urban areas. Now, with the spread of CCTV, many people are protected with greater safety. Even when crimes occur, the fact that safeguards exist to avoid unjust outcomes is a significant change. Likewise, I want to pursue research that ensures safety in everyday urban life while simultaneously enhancing convenience through more advanced technologies. Applying AI to transform ordinary cities into smart cities—creating changes that people can tangibly feel—that is my goal.

If I were to describe myself in a single sentence, I am an engineer who walks up the escalator. An escalator moves you forward even if you simply stand still, but I take one more step on it. A person who keeps climbing stairs without rest is diligent, and a person who uses the escalator is efficient. I choose both. I add diligence to efficiency and hold efficiency within diligence, moving forward without end. Defining myself this way helps me regain my center whenever today’s pages begin to scatter.

My role model is Joseph Swan. Many people remember Thomas Edison as the inventor of the light bulb, but it was Joseph Swan who first invented it. Edison undoubtedly commercialized the light bulb and popularized it, but it was Swan who first brought “light” to the world. Thanks to his invention, humanity could remain active even in the dark of night, and from the Second Industrial Revolution to the present day, our lives and society have been fundamentally transformed. I take him as my role model because his invention went beyond mere technology to produce happiness and convenience in people’s everyday lives. Like Joseph Swan, I hope that the technologies I develop will allow many people to feel happiness in their daily routines and live better lives.

Finally, I picture myself ten years from now. By then, I will surely have built up a broader range of knowledge and capabilities through many more experiences. I might have achieved financial success by running a business, or I might be receiving strong recognition and rewards at a major company. But the image I truly desire is not a list of external achievements. Ten years from now, I want to keep learning and growing as I do today, and I want to maintain a mindset that does not hesitate to face difficulties and to take on challenges. Even if my body ages with time, I hope my inner self remains filled with passion and a spirit of challenge. That spirit is what prompts me to take one more step forward today—to keep walking on the escalator.

If this record fully captures on a single page my beginnings and transitions, my learning and experiments, and the promises I make for what lies ahead, then today’s me has explained myself sufficiently to tomorrow’s me. And I return once more to the problems of data, models, and the city—so that I can solve tomorrow’s questions a little better.

I’m putting my tastes and hobbies into a journal entry—why I’m obsessed with football, whether I’m a mountain or beach person, what Busan dish I crave most, and the one meal I’d choose if it were my last. Little clues that add up to who I am.

Sports — Football I’m absolutely mad about football—both playing and watching. I try to get on the pitch at least twice a week. Why this sport clicks with me comes down to three things: first, it’s the perfect fusion of brain and brawn—tactical judgment and physical endurance matter in equal measure. Second, let’s be honest, it looks cool. Third, I’m fiercely competitive, and the thrill of competition really gets my blood pumping.

My position is winger—the same as Son Heung‑min. In football, goals are the ultimate reward, and a winger stands right at the heart of creating those magical moments. There’s nothing like taking on a defender one‑on‑one and ripping open a defensive structure with a burst of dribbling. Pure adrenaline.

But the essence of football, the part that hooks me, is that it’s never about a single scorer. It’s about eleven individuals, each playing a distinct role—some under the spotlight, others doing the unglamorous work in the shadows. The unnoticed tackle from a defender, the dummy run that opens space from a midfielder, the goalkeeper who keeps the backline organized—everything accumulates for that split second when the ball hits the net.

Programming—especially AI development—mirrors this beautiful game. You might have a “star player” who designs a breakthrough algorithm, but behind every successful deployment is someone optimizing queries, someone cleaning data, someone maintaining infrastructure. Like football, it’s the silent coordination and trust layered underneath that make the extraordinary possible. As a winger, I create chances and break defenses. In AI, I want to play that same role—combining diverse skills to open blocked paths and finding solutions where others see obstacles.

Beach or Mountain? — Beach Since I’m from Busan, that might sound obvious. But Busan is actually packed with mountains. Roughly 70% of Korea is mountainous, and even Seoul is surrounded by peaks. There’s a running joke that every Korean middle and high school anthem mentions its “guardian mountain.” Mine were no exception—my campuses were tucked against hillsides, which meant brutal climbs every morning. Mountains and I have a complicated relationship: a friend who makes life harder, but one I can’t bring myself to dislike.

The ocean, though, is therapy. A wide horizon that melts worries away. The sunsets, the light dancing on waves—“yunseul” (윤슬) in Korean—never gets old. And I’m obsessed with seafood. As a peninsula with three coasts, Korea does seafood with techniques and flavors you won’t find elsewhere.

So here’s my advice: when you visit Korea, don’t just stick to Seoul. Head to Busan, and check out the coasts in Gangwon‑do and the southern seas. I’ll stake my reputation on this: Korean seafood is among the most diverse and delicious in the world.

Busan Food — Milmyeon and Gukbap I’m all about milmyeon. And no—it’s not the same as naengmyeon that most visitors try. Koreans have this quirky love for ice‑cold noodles. Naengmyeon gets the fame, but milmyeon is Busan’s signature—our local pride. Other cities try to recreate it, but Busan’s hits different. My go‑to spot is Gaegeum Milmyeon; if you find yourself in Busan, do yourself a favor and go.

Busan is also famous for dwaeji gukbap (pork soup with rice). I’ve earned the nickname “Gukbap Minister” (a pun on “Defense Minister”). Busan’s broth is crystal clear and free of the porky funk you sometimes get elsewhere. It’s a game‑changer and absolutely worth trying.

Last Meal — My Mother’s Kimchi Jjigae Kimchi jjigae is soul food. In Korean, “jjigae” is heartier and more concentrated than regular soup—bolder, punchier. There are countless takes, but my favorite is loaded with ham and pork: not too spicy, but with a savory depth that makes it irresistible with rice.

In Korea we say “bap‑doduk,” literally “rice thief.” It says a lot about our food culture. “Bap” means both cooked rice and “a meal” itself. When a dish is so good that it steals your rice before you know it, we call it a rice thief. If I had to pick just one, my mother’s kimchi jjigae would be it—without a second thought.

Postscript — Today’s Resolve Like a winger on the pitch, I want to be the runner who pushes the team forward. In the syntax of code, data, infrastructure, and collaboration, I look for open spaces and create lanes for teammates to sprint into and score. Keep my mind as wide as the sea’s horizon, stay steady like a spoonful of kimchi jjigae. That’s how I let my tastes flow into my work—and live a life where the two reinforce each other.
